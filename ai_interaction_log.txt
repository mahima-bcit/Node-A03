AI Tool(s) Used:
- ChatGPT, Claude

What I used it for:
- Designing and improving the CSS stylesheet for project, including layout, color palette, mobile responsiveness, and page-specific components.
- Verifying expected API behavior (status codes, JSON shape, error responses)

Specific prompts/questions I asked (at least 3):
- What color palette should I use for a student software developer portfolio?
- How can I make the contact form beautiful?
- Reorganize this CSS file to make it more readable without changing any styling.
- The footer is not centered on mobile, how do I fix it?

What I changed after receiving the AI output (my own decisions):
- Chose the Slate Blue + Warm White palette (#3a67a9 and #fafaf8) from the options Claude suggested, because it felt professional without being too corporate.
- Added a sidebar on the contact page for additional contact links.
- Determined the final footer style, centered text at the bottom of every page.
